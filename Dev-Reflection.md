Final Project Reflection (Developer)
How did you interpret and implement someone elseâ€™s idea?

Interpreting and implementing the idea for Hobby Hub required a deep understanding of the project's vision and objectives. The concept was to create a website that caters to various interests, including NBA news around his favorite team (Cavaliers), Soccer (around FC Barcelona), Travel, a photo gallery, and a contact page. I focused on translating this vision into a functional and visually appealing website. This involved designing intuitive navigation, ensuring easy access to different sections, and creating a layout that enhances user engagement. By maintaining regular communication with the project manager, I was able to align the development process with the initial idea and make necessary adjustments based on feedback.

What were the challenges in development and collaboration?

One of the main challenges in development was formatting the website to meet the desired aesthetic and functional standards, especially on pages with a lot of images. Ensuring that images were properly aligned, responsive, and did not disrupt the overall layout required meticulous attention to detail. Collaboration also presented challenges, particularly in coordinating different aspects of the project and integrating various components seamlessly. However, regular meetings and feedback sessions helped us address these issues and improve our workflow.

Which parts did you use AI tools for, and what did you learn from that?

AI tools played a significant role in enhancing various aspects of the website. For instance, I used AI tools to implement the dark toggle mode, which allowed users to switch between light and dark themes effortlessly. These tools helped in optimizing the code and ensuring that the toggle functioned smoothly across different browsers and devices.

For hover effects, AI-driven design tools assisted in creating interactive elements that improved user experience. These tools provided suggestions for animations and transitions, making the website more dynamic and engaging.

In terms of JavaScript, AI-based code review tools were invaluable in identifying and rectifying errors quickly. They also offered optimization tips that improved the performance and efficiency of the scripts. Through this process, I learned the importance of leveraging AI tools to enhance development efficiency and ensure high-quality outcomes.
