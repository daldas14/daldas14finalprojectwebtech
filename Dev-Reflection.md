## Developer Final Project Reflection

I interpreted and understood Carlos's idea literally based on his requirements because he had specific colors, criteria, and logos he wanted me to use. The website aims to connect his business, Kliq, with his event, kliqFest. I also added my personal touch to the project, particularly on the Gallery page. I implemented an automatic slideshow for the pictures, which starts a few seconds after the page loads and cycles through all the images I included.

I enjoyed collaborating with Carlos. I asked many questions and sought feedback on what he wanted me to adjust, fix, or add, such as his logo. This was important to me because I understand how significant this website is for him and his business, and I wanted to ensure he was satisfied with the final product. Carlos has been an excellent project manager, responding to my GitHub issues promptly and clearly communicating his expectations.

However, there were some conflicting aspects for me. For instance, I would have organized the content differently. I believe the About page could have been merged with the Home page, and I would have made some aesthetic changes, such as modifying the navigation bar color. Nonetheless, I prioritized Carlos's vision, and my work aligns with his description and feedback to the best of my ability. My main challenge was the limited creative freedom, but I embraced this as a valuable real-world experience as a project developer.

I used AI tools to help debug my code, addressing issues like missing or extra brackets that prevented the code from running smoothly. AI also helped me condense my code. For example, some of my JavaScript code was lengthy, so I used AI to shorten it. This process revealed redundant logic I hadn't noticed, which taught me how to identify and eliminate such inefficiencies. Additionally, I learned to approach problems in multiple ways. For instance, I discovered that some tasks could be achieved using a `for` loop combined with `if-else` statements, which broadened my perspective on coding techniques. Both approaches worked efficiently, and the choice ultimately came down to personal preference.
