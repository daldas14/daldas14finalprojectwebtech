## PM Final Project Reflection

My project was inspired by two of my biggest hobbies: sports and traveling. To keep them organized, I focused on the sports I watch the mostâ€”basketball (NBA) and soccer (my favorite team being FC Barcelona).

### Collaboration Experience
The collaboration with Owen worked great. I appreciated him reaching out and asking for feedback before incorporating it. He captured my idea perfectly and even included aspects I had not thought about adding myself. These additions reflected his personal touch as a developer, and I liked them.

### Lessons Learned
From writing requirements for this project, I learned the importance of being as descriptive as possible. Clear requirements ensure the developer knows exactly what to do, avoiding misunderstandings that could lead to unsatisfactory results. However, I also realized the value of not entirely limiting the developer to strict requirements. Allowing some creative freedom can result in features or aspects you hadn't considered but end up appreciating.

To summarize, the key lessons I learned as a project manager are:
1. Be descriptive and clear in your requirements.
2. Allow room for the developer's creativity to shine.

Finding the right balance between fixed requirements and creative freedom is essential for a successful collaboration.

### Use of AI in Design
As a project manager, I used AI to assist with the design process. I had a basic structure in mind, such as a navigation bar and a homepage connecting to all the pages, but I was unsure about the overall design. I utilized Copilot's ability to generate designs. Starting with a basic design, I refined it by providing prompts like "include at the top" or "move the image to the left," along with images of what to include. Copilot updated the design iteratively until I was satisfied. I then sketched the final design on paper, which I submitted as the homepage sketch.
