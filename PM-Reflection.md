Final Project Reflection (PM)
How did you come up with your idea?

The idea for my front-end website project, Total News, emerged from my interest in creating a comprehensive and user-friendly news platform. I wanted to design a website that caters to diverse interests by offering categories such as business, technology, culture, local, national, and science. This concept was inspired by the need for a centralized source where users can easily access news from various domains. My goal was to create an engaging and informative platform that enhances the user experience through intuitive navigation and visually appealing design.

How well did the collaboration with your developer work?

Collaboration with my developer was a key component of this project. We established clear communication channels early on, which helped us stay aligned with our goals and deadlines. Regular messaging and feedback sessions ensured that we were on the same page and could address any issues promptly. Our teamwork was effective, and we leveraged each other's strengths to enhance the project's quality. This collaborative effort not only improved the final product but also enriched my understanding of working in a team environment. It was very easy working with my developer and made the entire process hastle free.

What did you learn about writing requirements?

Writing requirements was a significant learning experience for me. I realized the importance of being precise and detailed in outlining the project's scope and objectives. Clear requirements helped in minimizing misunderstandings and provided a solid foundation for the development process. I learned to anticipate potential challenges and include contingency plans in the requirements. This practice ensured that we could adapt to changes without compromising the project's integrity. Overall, writing thorough requirements was instrumental in guiding the project to successful completion. It also showed me that the process can be fluid, as hard as tried to include everything I wanted, there was always going to be details that I left out or that my developer brought up which I thought would be good to implement. 

Did you use any AI tools in this process? How?
I did not use AI tools in this process other than to identify which key news categories the website would offer. I wanted to make the project mostly my ideas but it helped to use it for indentifying categories because I wanted to see what type of news would be most desired to include in my website.
